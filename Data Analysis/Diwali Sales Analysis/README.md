Welcome to the Diwali Sales Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of Diwali sales data using powerful Python libraries. 

### Our goal is 
- improving customer experience by analyzing sales data 
- increase revenue
## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.

## Project Overview
In this project, we perform an in-depth analysis of Diwali sales data to explore and visualize key insights. This includes **data cleaning**, **EDA**, and a variety of visualizations to better understand the sales trends during the Diwali season.

## Getting Started
To get started with this analysis, clone the repository and ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib
```

## Analysis Details
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle unwanted columns 
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use various plots and charts to uncover trends, correlations, and insights.
3. **Visualization**: Leverage Seaborn and Matplotlib to create compelling visual representations of the data.

## Conclusion
Married women age group 26-35 yrs from UP, Maharastra and Karnataka working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation are more likely to buy products from Food, Clothing and Electronics category
